 * REPLPAD (MAIN CONSOLE/TUTORIAL WIDGET)
 *
 * It's important that the replpad take up the full vertical space, because
 * it needs to be able to get clicks in big empty space regions in order to
 * focus the cursor...since the input span can be small and hard to click.
 *
 * https://stackoverflow.com/a/7049918  ; sizing to 100%
 * https://stackoverflow.com/a/9183467  ; get clicks on replpad, not children
 * https://stackoverflow.com/q/31982407  ; selections aren't clicks

/* Weird but essential UI trick: the `replpad` div is split in two parts.  The
 * outer container is flipped vertically, and then we flip the inner part
 * vertically to undo the transformation.  This maniacal trick is needed to
 * pull off a cross-browser behavior that makes the scroll bar appear "sticky"
 * wherever the user put it...including to track the latest output if it was
 * "stuck to the bottom":
 *
 * https://stackoverflow.com/a/34345634/
 *
 * A side effect is that this reverses the mouse wheel direction, which has to
 * be undone with code JavaScript in the .js file.  If you have an easier way
 * to do this, then be my guest...but other approaches were not working:
 *
 * https://stackoverflow.com/q/54626982/
 *
 * (Note: It's a sad commentary on the state of browser design that such a
 * convolutedd workaround is needed to get such common sense UI behavior.)

 * CUSTOM SCROLLBAR
 *
 * The default scroll bar has fairly useless arrows on the top and bottom and

 * reduces the visual noise and saves space.  This uses a riff on "Style 11"
 * from here, changed to match the splitter more closely.
 *
 * https://scotch.io/tutorials/customize-the-browsers-scrollbar-with-css
 *
 * !!! This technique doesn't work on Firefox, but so long as the worst that
 * happens is "you just get the default OS scroll bar" that is fine.
