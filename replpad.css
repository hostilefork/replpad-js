 * REPLPAD (MAIN CONSOLE/TUTORIAL WIDGET)
 *
 * It's important that the replpad take up the full vertical space, because
 * it needs to be able to get clicks in big empty space regions in order to
 * focus the cursor...since the input span can be small and hard to click.
 *
 * https://stackoverflow.com/a/7049918  ; sizing to 100%
 * https://stackoverflow.com/a/9183467  ; get clicks on replpad, not children
 * https://stackoverflow.com/q/31982407  ; selections aren't clicks

/* Weird but essential UI trick: the `replpad` div is split in two parts.  The
 * outer container is flipped vertically, and then we flip the inner part
 * vertically to undo the transformation.  This maniacal trick is needed to
 * pull off a cross-browser behavior that makes the scroll bar appear "sticky"
 * wherever the user put it...including to track the latest output if it was
 * "stuck to the bottom":
 *
 * https://stackoverflow.com/a/34345634/
 *
 * A side effect is that this reverses the mouse wheel direction, which has to
 * be undone with JavaScript code in %gui.js - if you have an easier way to do
 * this, then be my guest...but other approaches were not working:
 *
 * https://stackoverflow.com/q/54626982/
 *
 * (Note: It's a sad commentary on the state of browser design that such a
 * convoluted workaround is needed to get such common sense UI behavior.)

     *     YOUR LONG PROMPT HERE>> the input you type when it's long will wrap
     *                             like this with `display: block`
     *
     * A second choice is `display: inline-block`, which looks good at first
     *
     *     YOUR LONG PROMPT HERE>> so far so good for `display: inline-block`

     * But it will jump to the next line if it gets too long for one line:
     *
     *     YOUR LONG PROMPT HERE>>
     *     so far so good for `display: inline-block` but wait, now it's not

     * With `display: inline` we get the desired wrapping...
     *
     * ...HOWEVER...there have been many unfortunate quirks encountered.  One
     * issue is that in Chromium browsers, empty inline elements will not show
     * a cursor.  But since there is an `:empty` CSS selector, those can be
     * set to `inline-block` without it making a difference.
     *
     * But a problem that could not be overcome was that input is mucked up
     * when typing words on android inline contentEditable elements, when using
     * the default "Gboard".  Many people have looked at this with no easy fix:
     *
     * https://github.com/hostilefork/replpad-js/issues/98
     *
     * !!! For now we say `display: inline-block` just to not have conditional
     * Android behavior, to see if that's going to be good enough.

     * a *negative* margin to compensate.  This makes the clickable area of the
     * input overlap its left neighbor--if any--a little bit without actually
