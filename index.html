 ! It's generally the goal of the project to be a "single page", where most
 ! all interaction happens inside the console widget.  It will have tutorials
 ! and such, but those will be data-driven and content written in something
 ! friendlier than HTML, such as MarkDown.  So this may wind up being the only
 ! HTML page there is, with all content dynamically inserted into it.

      // "Web workers" always load from their own script URL.  Chrome won't
      // load them from local `file://` URLs, see README.md for workaround.
      //
      // Start loading the worker directly from this first html file, don't
      // wait for a second fetch of a script to then have *that script* do the
      // fetch.
      //
      // !!! This method of declaring a global var is contentious with modules
      // in JavaScript, which seem to be a nightmare and don't actually work.
      // But if someday they do work, this probably needs rethinking.
      //
      var pump = new Worker('worker.js');
