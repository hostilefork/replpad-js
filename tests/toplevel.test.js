// Some features of libRebol can't be used from inside of a rebPromise().
// (Even if they could be, they would still be running under different
// conditions at the top level.)
//
// Getting to what libRebol considers the "top level" cannot happen with
// JS-DO and its implementation of adding a <script> tag to the page.
// That is because JS-DO is an awaiter and must be run in a rebPromise().
// The *entire* REPL session itself runs inside a rebPromise() in fact,
// and doesn't exit that promise until you QUIT.
//
// For the moment, these tests are included in the ReplPad boot just as
// that boot is done very often.  The test project should be separate.
